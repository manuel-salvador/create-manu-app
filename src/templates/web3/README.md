This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) project bootstrapped with [`create-manu-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-manu-app).

## Getting Started

First, get your API key at [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io) then add it to the .env file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY='your_api_key'
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
