# create-manu-app

This is an NPM package that allows you to quickly create a Next.js project and TypeScript, without the experimental app directory. Additionally, it installs Tailwind CSS and configures the necessary files. If you're creating a web3 project, it also installs RainbowKit.

## Usage

To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-manu-app
# or
yarn create manu-app
# or
pnpm create manu-app

```

## Web3 projects

If you're creating a web3 project, you must have an Alchemy API key before starting the development server. You can get your API key at [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io) then add it to the .env file
